Bastille Tracking Number 21
CVE-2017-9522

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that enables an attacker to connect to a Time Warner customer's Wi-Fi network, provided that the customer's gateway is using the default Wi-Fi credentials. This allows the attacker to access the Internet for free, and attribute any malicious activity to the Time Warner customer they are impersonating.



Affected Platforms

Technicolor TC8717T



Proof-of-Concept Details

The default Wi-Fi passphrase is a combination of the SSID and BSSID, making it trivial for an attacker to connect to a Time Warner customer's Wi-Fi network.

Default Wi-Fi credentials are configured as follows:

SSID:       TC8717T66
Passphrase: TC8717T334466
BSSID:      00:11:22:33:44:55

By observing a beacon frame, which contains the SSID and BSSID, an attacker is able to generate the passphrase, and connect to the customer's private Wi-Fi network.



Test Environment

Technicolor TC8717T



Mitigation

Time Warner customers can mitigate this vulnerability by changing the Wi-Fi credentials on their gateway.



Recommended Remediation

Use default Wi-Fi credentials which are difficult for an attacker to guess.
