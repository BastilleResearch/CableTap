Bastille Tracking Number 31
CVE-2017-9488

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that enables an attacker to remotely log into a target gateway using hardcoded credentials.



Affected Platforms:

Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST
Cisco DPC3941T, firmware version DPC3941_2.5s3_PROD_sey



Proof-of-Concept

Comcast residential gateways expose the web UI to incoming connections on the wan0 interface. On the wan0 interface, the web UI can be accessed with either hardcoded or generated credentials.

There are two barriers which prevent attackers from accessing this web UI: 

1) The IPv6 address of the wan0 interface on a target gateway must be known. 

2) The wan0 interface cannot be accessed from the public internet. 

The IPv6 address can be obtained from the CM MAC (Bastille Tracking Number 30).



Test Environment:

Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST
Cisco DPC3941T, firmware version DPC3941_2.5s3_PROD_sey



Mitigation

There is no apparent mechanism to allow Comcast customers to control or change this behavior.



Recommended Remediation

Move to certificate-based authentication, and restrict customer gateway wan0 access so that it cannot be accessed via the Send To TV web browser feature.
