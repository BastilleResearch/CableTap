Bastille Tracking Number 18
CVE-2017-9476

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that enables an attacker to connect to a hidden Wi-Fi access point running on a Comcast customer's gateway. This allows the attacker to access the Internet for free, and attribute any malicious activity to the Comcast customer they are targeting.



Affected Platforms

Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421733-160420a-CMCST
Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST
Arris TG1682G, eMTA&DOCSIS version 10.0.132.SIP.PC20.CT, software version TG1682_2.2p7s2_PROD_sey



Proof-of-Concept

Many residential gateways include a hidden home security Wi-Fi network, which is active regardless of whether or not the customer is subscribed to this service.

There is a deterministic way to generate the hidden SSID and its passphrase.



Test Environment

Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421733-160420a-CMCST
Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST
Arris TG1682G, eMTA&DOCSIS version 10.0.132.SIP.PC20.CT, software version TG1682_2.2p7s2_PROD_sey



Mitigation

There is no apparent mechanism to allow customers to disable this Wi-Fi network.



Recommended Remediation

Disable the home security network for customers who do not subscribe to this service.

Use secure passphrases which cannot be generated using readily available information.
