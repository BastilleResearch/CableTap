Bastille Tracking Number 40
CVE-2017-9496

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that enables an attacker to access an SNMP server running on the Motorola MX011ANM.



Affected Platforms

Motorola MX011ANM, firmware version MX011AN_2.9p6s1_PROD_sey



Proof-of-Concept

The Motorola MX011ANM includes an Ethernet port, which upon first glance appears to be inactive. Assuming a similar addressing scheme to the wireless gateways, which use a clustered range of MAC addresses and IPv6 addresses based on the MAC addresses, we were able to guess the link local IPv6 address of the Ethernet port. 

We then discovered that an SNMP server running on the set-top box can be accessed by addressing the link-local IPv6 address of the Ethernet port.



Test Environment

Motorola MX011ANM, firmware version MX011AN_2.9p6s1_PROD_sey



Mitigation

There is no apparent mechanism to allow Comcast customers to change this behavior.



Recommended Remediation

Patch the arbitrary file read vulnerability we used to learn the community string.
