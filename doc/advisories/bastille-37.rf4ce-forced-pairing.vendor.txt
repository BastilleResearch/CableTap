Bastille Tracking Number 37
CVE-2017-9493

Overview

The RF4CE remote pairing mechanism on the Motorola MX011ANM set-top box has been shown to be vulnerable to a forced pairing attack.



Affected Platforms

Motorola MX011ANM, firmware version MX011AN_2.9p6s1_PROD_sey



Proof-of-Concept

An attacker can force-pair an RF4CE remote with a target set-top box by repeatedly transmitting the same pairing code. In practice, we have demonstrated this to take approximately two hours to complete. 



Test Environment

Motorola MX011ANM, firmware version MX011AN_2.9p6s1_PROD_sey



Mitigation

There is no apparent mechanism to allow Comcast customers to change this behavior.



Recommended Remediation

Implement rate-limiting to prevent an unlimited number of pairing sequence attempts.
